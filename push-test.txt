push test

not really a push test message, but i have to say it, i am so happy right now,
I have used past hours to migrate to uefi with just compiling a function that 
just returns with etk2, and I am literally doing this thing just because
I don't have to use all those headers or whatever, and the point of nay
is to be free of whatever and licensing things, and generally be something
that is independent (same reason I haven't used grub, limine or whatever), 
and I just discovered that I don't have to use it and I am so happy,
I hope it will work

i hate headers and libraries to be honest, just give me the system table 
without all of these different things

you couldn't imagine what I have written in the new readme file about
my opinion on it, it was so long and list of things that you had to do
to just setup the build was huge too and I hated it so much

have a good day
